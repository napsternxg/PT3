Probabilistic Tic Tac Toe
==========================

Introduction
-------------

This is a modified version of the tic tac toe game which uses a coin toss in every turn of a player to play on one of the two selected places. 
This leads to a higher chance of result in the game and makes the game a bit more fun because of the randomness of the toss result. 

Rules
-----

 * For each turn the player should select 2 spots on the grid which they will use for the toss. 
 * The player should click toss which will make a toss between 0 and 1 and will play either of the 2 spots the player has selected. 
 * After the toss the second player should play their turn exactly the same was as the original player.
